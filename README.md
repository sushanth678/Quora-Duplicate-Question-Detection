# Quora-Duplicate-Question-Detection
On Quora, multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question. Quora values canonical questions because they provide a better experience to active seekers and writers, and offer more value to both of these groups in the long term. In this project, I have applyed advanced techniques to classify whether question pairs are duplicates or not. To summary the problem is identifying which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that have already been asked. In this project, I have experimented with various text preprocessing, feature engineering techniques like Fuzzy features and compared the performance of various algorithms Logistic regression, XGBoost, Siamese Network. Got the best results by using the Siamese adaptation of a Bidirectional GRU with Bert Embeddings.
